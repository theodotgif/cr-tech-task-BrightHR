# Bright Android Technical Test 2023

This project forms the basis for the technical task for Android developer applicants.
Please CAREFULLY read ALL these instructions before beginning the task.

The starting code of the application is *DELIBERATELY BAD* - it will not function correctly
in its current state. The code contains *bugs* and several examples of *bad practice* 
according to Modern Android Development.
This gives you the opportunity to demonstrate your ability to fix and improve
badly-written legacy code.

* The task should take around 3 hours to complete
* You are welcome to consult the internet, documentation or code you have written to help you
* We encourage you to use tools like the debugger and Layout Inspector to diagnose issues.

*We will assess you on:*

* Understanding of best practices in Android development
* Clear code organisation
* The size and message of git commits

*We are less concerned with:*

* UI styling / animation etc.

## The Starter Project

This project uses the JSON placeholder API to display a list of posts. 
The list includes the title of each post and an
excerpt from each post's body.

## Your task:

1. Survey the code in this project and leave comments under everything you notice 
that needs to be fixed or improved.
2. Pick 2 or 3 of these issues and implement fixes / improvements.
    - Feel free to refactor and change the architecture of the code
    - You can add 3rd party libraries if you wish (be prepared to explain your choices)
3. We would like to see at least one example of either a *Unit* test or a *compose* UI test
4. Suggest other improvements you might make if you had a few days to work on the code.

## The API

The app uses the following endpoints from the [JSON
placeholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com) API:

    GET https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/

    GET https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/{POST_ID}/

    GET https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/{POST_ID}/comments/

## Submitting your work

-   You should submit the above as either a compressed git repository (zip file)
    or a link to your repository on github or similar hosting service.
    Please commit regularly as you carry out the task and
    keep the commit history in tact.

## Interview pairing tasks

In your interview we will ask you more about your process in completing the above tasks.

There will also be a short exercise where you will be paired with one of our Android team member
and given a task to develop this project further. You will have full access to internet
resources to help you.
